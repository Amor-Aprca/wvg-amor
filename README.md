1. inject.js injected by content.js gets Widevine PSSH by hooking EME.
2. background.js fetches POST URLs/Headers
3. PSSHs will passed by this route inject.js-->content.js-->background.js-->popup.js
4. PSSHs+URLs+Headers will passed by this route background.js-->popup.js
5. popup.js will contols UI(popup.html)
6. User input into UI
7. popup.js calls pywidevine script using pyodide in browser
